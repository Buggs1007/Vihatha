        <h2>NANI - Rediscovering Nature & Nutrition through an immersive experience </h2>
        <p>
        Human beings have diverse qualities and multiple dimensions of intelligence. Naturalist intelligence is one of them. It not only helps to know about nature but also helps to build a deeper understanding about ourselves. Many cultures in the world still insist on ‘forest baths’ and ‘nature baths’ for personal development. Such experiences cultivate awe, wonder, gratitude and reverence. These emotions design and create the necessary mental and emotional space within the child for his/her development. </p>
      <p>The current education system (barring few exceptions) doesn’t provide the systems or processes to observe, feel, think and reflect in nature and therefore our team at VIHATHA thought about introducing a unique course to develop self-awareness, natural awareness and experiential understanding about nutrition. 
This workshop aims at providing an immersive experience in nature, know organic farming and nutrition. It will provide a robust framework to the learners to evaluate the what, why and how about food.
