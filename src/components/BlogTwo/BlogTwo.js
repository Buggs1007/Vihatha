        <h1>Muni International School,Delhi : </h1>
        <h2>– ‘A school which believes in leading by example instead of criticizing others’ <br/> <br/> - Rovin Pushp </h2>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This school is located in remote sub-urban slum area
of West Delhi named as Mohan Garden, 5 kms away
from Dwarka. Mohan garden is inhabited by lower
middle class/poor families struggling to get basic
amenities and fulfil their aspirations in this world.
Interestingly, the chowk close to the school is
named as Gandhi Chowk. This is the place where
Mr. Ashok Thakur started his quest for providing
quality education to low income families in 2002.
We have tried to understand his quest,
achievements as well as challenges faced by the
school and tried to understand how they have
established themselves as a ‘huge advantage’ for
the community where he is able to provide good
academic learning, plenty of co-curricular activities, life
skills, universal human value education, leadership skills, English language competence, foreign language,
computer related skills etc. at such a low cost.
Despite being a low-investment school in a
disadvantaged locality, this school offers separate
classrooms for each class with proper ventilation,
clean and purified drinking water, kitchen garden,
separate toilet for boys and girls, facilities for
arts/crafts/music, library, science laboratory, tab
for each student to access online and offline
learning resources, teaching
Japanese/French/German etc. The school is
accessible to all kinds of students. In general, they
encourage poor performing students to take
admission in the school. This school doesn’t
believe in grabbing the talent, owning and
showcasing it. On the contrary, it believes in
handholding academically weak students and
helping them excel in their lives. Most of the students come from immediate surroundings while a few of
them come from far away locations. Some parents have also taken a house/flat/room on rent so that their
children can study in this school. This school is affiliated till class 10th. They are not able to get affiliation
for class 12th due to RTE/infrastructure related rules. Currently, 700 students are studying in this school.
The school has 40 staff members out of which 30 are teachers. Most of the teachers come from nearby
community. They are trained in school’s philosophy and methodology so that they are able to facilitate
the processes in an efficient manner.

        <h1>Perspectives that guide the school-</h1>
        <p>The founder shared that he couldn’t get proper education during childhood due to financial & structural
problems (there was a pain/concern that it shouldn’t happen to other children like him), most of the
things he learnt was through experiences, facing challenges, inquiry and he was curious to know how
people become KNOWLEDGEABLE These things helped to shape his philosophy and later the school’s
philosophy. He also shared his experiences from army where initially he was not able to cope up with
physical training, was ridiculed due to poor performance but won many awards later in the same field. He
also feels that failing in life rarely gives us another opportunity but in school/educational institutions many
artificial situations can be created to test ourselves and learn from experience. Engagement with tough &
challenging situations gives us the clarity and confidence that we can do something in the outside world.
He creates lot of difficult situations and challenges through which students gain practical experiences. He
believes that human beings can falter but can also become ‘able’ at doing something through dedication
and hard work.   

<br/> <br/>

About being knowledgeable he received many answers – focus on memorizing, thinking,
analysing, focus on concepts, meditation, meditating on the subject, good genes, good deeds
from past lives, understanding reality, etc. He chose understanding reality as the option for
teaching self and children as a guiding principle. He feels that once anyone starts understanding
reality about self, nature, relationships and society, the door of knowledge automatically opens
for the person and the person is able to live the knowledge thus attained. He has seen it through
personal experiences and multiple experiences with children. He also says that children are
naturally endowed to learn and acquire knowledge and skills. E.g he quoted one incident from a
workshop in VandeMatram Foundation where he was involved in organizing a workshop for
children where 1400 children learnt 40-45 skills within 40 days without any teacher. 

<br/> <br/>

Along with their inherent core beliefs about human beings, education and content of education, they have
also learnt from Madhyastha darshan/Jeevan Vidya which shares lot of common perspectives with their
idea of a good human being/school/society. This philosophy has given them a detailed vision & plan to
work up on and added more fuel to their passion, curiosity and creative energy. In short, the school’s
philosophy proposes that human beings have the potential to live healthily, happily, prosperously
5 | P a g e
and be useful to family and society. Education is the tool through which this potential can be
converted into ability. They believe that increase in human understanding and sensitivity can
lead to stronger character and efficiency in work. The founder says that real education means
harmony between gyan, vigyan and vivek. (can be loosely translated as knowledge, science &
rationality).

<br/> <br/>

Mr. Ashok Thakur says that he doesn’t prefer activism, he prefers to work and lead by example.
His school and its philosophy is a response to inefficiency/malpractices in the field of education.
And these thoughts didn’t occur suddenly. Slowly, they have expanded their philosophy based on their
work and study – a philosophy that is aimed at evolution of human being through developing his/her
understanding, providing life skills and leadership skills. This philosophy defines purpose of education for
them as well – an education that provides happiness, self-discipline and makes a person useful for family
and society. He says - an ideal education should also make student a self-learner, so that he/she can
learn from anything/anyone and use that learning for his work/life. So, instead of giving all the attention
on creating knowledge and skills for livelihood one should also learn about self, relationships, nature,
social institutions and systems, etc.

        <h1>Key points about school philosophy and its practical implications</h1>
        <p>The Muni methodology facilitates a child to prepare adequately for the approaching future,
today. This is through a combination of self-organization, self-management, self-exploration and
clarity of understanding one-self in the larger context of co-existence along with the
interdependencies and interconnections that make co-existence possible.

            <li>They have created their own way of following constructivist philosophy. They have created a study pattern which encourages child to think, analyze, imagine, relate to live experiences, see utility of knowledge in practical life, etc.</li>
            <li>Extra emphasis on character development - Understanding self through discussion and behavior, understanding relationships, social issues, etc. (e.g for understanding what is right food habit teachers The term eating habits ( Food habits ) refer to why and how people eat, which foods they eat, and with whom they eat as well as the way people obtain, store, use and discard food.</li>

        <h1 className='textcenter'>Ways to motivate and engage students in a more meaningfull manner</h1>
        <ol>
            <li> 
                <h3>Guided discovery</h3>
                is very useful method adopted by the school as it helps the children to
identify, compare, analyze, build & evaluate their hypotheses, etc. Thus, it helps to channelize
intellectual & creative energy of the children. It has contributed immensely to the teaching
profession as well, firstly channeling the high energy of children into an inspired learning and
teaching activity and secondly providing the teacher an opportunity to work very creatively on
facilitation and guided discovery of the child with focus and energy. 
            
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3> RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) </h3>
                division exists since the inception of the school in
2002, to monitor stumbling blocks or learning obstacles that a student might face as well as
teaching methodologies. It also works to find the future needs of our society, our country or the
world at large within their respective cultures and traditions
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3>Aiklavya method –</h3>
                – self-study system in which all learning methods are included into
single fold. This method grants each child independence and self-reliance to bring out
their true understanding and talent through their own efforts. This framework re-imagines
every student to be both, a learner as well as a teacher, encouraging creation and sharing of
knowledge within the classroom. 
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3> GRS/Group Reciprocal System –</h3>
                All children are divided into groups for deep and
focused learning. Group is responsible for learning and growth of each child. They do their
work collaboratively and understand each topic together. They can approach the teacher if
they are not able to understand any topic
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3>UPLC-</h3>
                Its a study pattern followed by them. ( Understand – identify problems/questions
with the concept– learn – complete information and create. ) Each and every child from
class 3-10 is aware about the process and follows it for their learning. This study pattern
is also pasted on the walls. e.g while learning triangles children learn about the concept,
practice problems, but they also reflect on OBSERVING & IDENTIFYING traingles
around them and how newly acquired concepts/principles can be applied by them.
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3> Teachers appreciation and feedback</h3>
                teachers appreciate and reinforce good behavior.
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3>Am I able –</h3>
                – focus on self and evaluation of self (by the child) to learn right evaluation of
one’s knowledge and behavior. They also discuss their understanding with fellow students
and juniors to see whether they have actually understood or not.
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3>Jeevan Vidya</h3>
                as universal human value education – Purpose of education is making
each child understand the true purpose in life and live in personal, family, social and
natural life accordingly. Jeevan vidya, a new concept intended to teach them live
harmoniously with self, family, society and nature
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3>Role play</h3>
                It  is widely used in primary classes to increase sensitivity, empathy, linguistic
abilities and conceptual knowledge
            </li>
            <li>
                 <h3>Hexagonal seating arrangement</h3>
                 so that there is no seating first or last, everyone can see
the teacher/other children and the teacher can see each child. Children sit in small groups
(6-8 students in each group).

        The Founder and the principal personally interact with students about their learning to see how
teachers are working. They also give and receive feedback on teaching and learning processes
after classroom observation. Each child is given multiple opportunities to excel according to their
talent and interests. The school puts emphasis not just on academics but on good behaviour,
arts, yoga, dance, theatre etc.

        We found out that the school realizes that it’s not practically possible to be there with each
student and each child all the time. So, they have utilized their experiences to create a system
which automatically keeps the teachers and learners in a reflective mode. For example - The
system is designed in a way that the teacher begins a topic with ‘situation creation’ by asking
questions and then giving the lesson for understanding and then share their understanding
within group and with the rest of the groups as well. Later, he/she has to further problematize
the topic to help them understand it in details.

        <br/> <br/>

        Children lead the teaching and verify each other’s knowledge through discussion (teacher observes). It is
very difficult for the teacher to speak without listening. Most of the time teacher begins a topic
by asking questions or generating a discussion and then giving them something to read and
share their understanding, later he/she has to further problematize the topic to help them
understand it in details, also create interesting assignments etc. Sometimes children lead the
teaching and sometimes they verify each other’s knowledge through discussion (teacher
observes). During these processes, teacher listens to the child and knows about their interests
and knowledge. They consider it while giving assignments/interacting with them. 

        <br/> <br/>

        Parliamentary system and court enables students to learn leadership, empathy, teamwork,
critical thinking, responsibility & participation in society. Child’s self-respect and dignity is
increased through giving them challenges and responsibilities. e.g through parliamentary
committees multiple responsibilities like cleanliness, beautification, events, educating a visitor about the
school, etc. are shared. Every child gets an opportunity for becoming an MP/MLA as roles are changed
every month.

            <li>Morning assembly. (No morning prayer, all the teachers/MPs/MLAs take an oath that
they will give their best despite any challenges to create valuable education for
everyone in the school). All the students are divided in 4 groups club, cultural, health
and sports and they have to go to one particular theme from another in specified
period of time. They have to pursue one theme for one week. Thus, each child gets
proper exposure of each theme in a month. New activities are added/conducted in
these themes to make these sessions interesting and there is plenty of learning
exchange.</li>
            <li>Subject wise periods. </li>
            <li> Each subject follows UPLC study pattern (understand, find problems/questions, learn
and create)
</li>

        <p>
        Teachers are trained by founder/senior teachers within Muni International School, Delhi. They
are also given periodic training/instructions by Principal and Academic director. During selection,
management keeps in mind that that they give priority to aptitude and knowledge over prior
experience and qualification. In this manner, they get teachers who can adapt to their philosophy
and methodology. Above all, he has created a system which has to be followed by teachers &
students inside the school. (e.g focus more listening and speaking with the child in younger
classes instead of directly jumping on writing, pattern of learning – Group discussion, UPLC
(understand, problem, learn, create) and group rreciprocal system.)
        
        <br/><br/>

        Children are learning from behaviour and small discussions as per syllabus and context; parents
learn it gradually through students and parent-teacher meetings. Children are happy, confident
and have basic clarity about the philosophy. The school management urges the parents to listen
to their experiences and insights from school and ask questions.
        
        <br/> <br/>
        There is specially focus to - 

        <ol>

        <h1>Learning about nutrition, health, acupressure, etc.</h1>
        <p>
        Students self-govern themselves, teachers pitch in if they aren’t able to resolve any issue by
themselves. The school has written zero-tolerance towards bullying in the centre of each class
(right above the blackboard). If any students tries to disrupt the class or misbehaves with
someone then the entire class is supposed to immediately object towards the behaviour. In
14 | P a g e
addition to it, there is a judiciary committee run by students who has a representative within
each class to oversee matters of bullying, indiscipline etc. Teachers do not subscribe to hard
methods, instead teacher talks with parents and child/group to overcome limitations. They
support and help the child to learn from mistakes and perform. still, if any child is adamant about
his behavior then they restricate the child. There is no compromise on discipline. The founder
says that he can tolerate inefficieny in academic work but can’t tolerate indiscipline if it is
influencing school culture. Children are clear about this rule.

encouraged to write their lesson plans. Principal and director personally involve themselves in
teaching and learning processes and observe classrooms. For content and methodology, they
have fixed some study patterns (based on experience). These study patterns/resources work as
guidelines for new teachers. They also prepare a monthly class-wise/school-wise schedule and

        <h1>What i liked and wish to learn from….</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal qualities which are quite evident in children- self-discipline, confidence, honesty,
teamwork, logic and reasoning, anticipation/guessing/ability to make predictions,
communication, patience, etc. (although these qualities can be developed towards a
higher stage but looking at most of existing schools, it’s simply brilliant.)</li>
            <li>Both teachers and children are aware about established systems and processes of learning
(UPLC, guided learning, finding examples related to concept being learnt, GRS, panchadik,
dashadik, Am I able, discussion around jeevan vidya sutras, purpose behind creating
different learning corners/themes on walls, role play etc.) I could clearly see shared vision
and clarity in planning & instruction behind this success (for establishing good pedagogical
practices like these…)
</li>
            <li>Good listening and observation ability demonstrated by children during
presentation/interaction/small or large group work. They were not interfering while
someone else is speaking and simultaneously were able to contribute/add their thoughts
when their friend was not clear while presenting about their classroom process/interacting
with me or during group work in class. (and everything was being done in a
natural/organic way).</li>
            <li>Students have taken ownership of their learning. They were eager to learn, participate in
peer review processes and authenticate their learning with the help of their peers/teacher.
</li>
            <li>Children were able to articulate their thoughts. (I could see a clear connection between
their knowledge/ideas and the way they were expressing it with the help of
examples/analogy).
</li>
            <li>Children are able to tell and describe Jeevan Vidya related sutras. They have understood
the basics and working on understanding it at a higher level.</li>
            <li>Teachers are humble and provide respect to students, they explained everything to me
with same amount of respect, simplicity and honesty.</li>
            <li>It was nice to see contemporary knowledge being respected/acknowledged along with
teaching/studying universal truth. (Studying theories and data provided by scientists
along with studying Jeevan Vidya/Madhyastha darshan).
</li>
            <li>This school has simplified deep philosophical concepts in a unique manner. It was simply
amazing to see class 6 children concepts like ‘tanha’ and ‘thirst’ during discussion on
religion and ideas.</li>
            <li>Providing multiple stimuli, smartly removing filters, hindrances & inhibition (encouraging
the students to understand and communicate without initially worrying about
technicalities, being authentic and natural in expression) in a foreign language has
worked.</li>
