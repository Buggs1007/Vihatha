        <h2>Let us try to understand 5 reasons to design and develop a rich kitchen garden in your school.   </h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Climate change and Sustainable living - The School kitchen garden is not just good for the school but also very beneficial for ecological balance. Scientists around the world are saying that it is the fastest and cheapest way to fight climate change. These tiny plants capture carbon and convert them into roots, stems, branches, leaves, flowers and fruits. Thatâ€™s how the carbon cycle is balanced. Also, if children learn to grow vegetables and start doing it at home then they move towards self reliance for vegetables. They can also inspire others to grow their own vegetables.  </li>
          <hr />
          <li>Skills - It develops competencies like observation, sensitivity, critical thinking, planning, imagination, creativity and teamwork.  </li>
          <hr />
          <li>Technical awareness and innovation - It helps the students to learn about various tools, methods and material used in horticulture. They can also try news ideas in designing and maintaining the kitchen garden.
