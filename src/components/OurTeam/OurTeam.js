        <h2>MEETING THOUGHT LEADERS AND PRACTITIONERS BRINGING CHANGE </h2>
        <p>
        They also participated in many seminars and workshops about various social 
        and environmental challenges. During these seminars, most of the discussions 
        zeroed down to required policy changes. Sometimes the discussion also shifted 
        to action as individuals and civil society - what we can do to tackle those 
        problems. Various solutions, methods and models of change were also discussed 
        in these meetings. ‘SEWA (service) as a method to work for building a 
        sustainable society appealed the most to them.
        <br /><br />
        That’s how Vihatha came into existence. It has picked three key focus 
        areas to bring the desired changes -
        <ul>
            <li>EDUCATION</li>
            <li>SUSTAINABILITY</li>
            <li>WELL-BEING</li>

        </ul>
