        <p>
        This kindergarten starts at 7.45 a.m. When I reached there, teachers and students were gathering for prayer in their respective classrooms. I was told to wait for kalaben. While she was about to come, I looked around without directly interacting with the children and teachers. It’s a place where one can easily sit quietly and look at the garden, flowers and esthetics of the place. I also enjoyed my time in silence.

        The school has got enough space for a kindergarten. This school has 3 big rooms and a playground. 10 teachers and 40 children were present in the premises before the prayer. All the children seemed to be in the pre-primary age group (3 to 7 years). Different kinds of storybooks, puzzles, musical instruments, toys, see saw, swings, etc. are available. Kalaben arrived right before the assembly. She seemed to be more than 80 years old (later during the conversation, I got to know she is 85 years old). She was finding it difficult to walk (even stand) due to some pain. Still, she walked with me in all the three rooms and explained about the school and its resources. Then, we sat in an empty space and Kalaben shared her experiences. I was surprised to see such reverence towards work in this situation. But, after the conversation I realized that why she was taking so much pain to share her experiences. 
        <br/> <br/>
        Kalaben and her family met Sri Aurobindo and the mother in 1946. She was in Africa an Gujarat before she came to Pondicherry as a 14 year old. She continued her studie informally and helped in Ashram activities for 8 years. In 1954, she was given th responsibility of teaching in kindergarten (which she had to begin from scratch). Mothe asked her to begin a learning space for young children. Kalaben was clueless about her rol with children. The Mother simply told – ‘you love children, children love you. You simply g there and speak in French.’ So, her job was to play with them, speak with them in French teach French and share stories, etc. She invented many interesting games, flashcards, etc to involve them, teach French and increase their curiosity. This school did not have an homework or bag (still they are continuing with the same principle). Initially, there wer infrastructure and timings related problems. They were not getting proper place and spac to teach. There were around 25-30 children in the school for the first decade. Then, mothe got 30 fresh applications in 1963. She shared her intent about taking all the children an asked Kalaben about it. In order to ensure good quality education for all the children Kalaben asked for a bigger infrastructure and human resources. Thus, she got ne members for teaching and a new building. Slowly, they started building child friendl infrastructure within and around the building. They have built swings with rocks, marble an cement and it is really very beautiful and smooth. They have also built a small mountai and garden for children. After making all these initial changes, the school was properl established in 1968. Initially, they were teaching only French. They were also trying to hel them understand basic concepts, identify objects etc. Teachers were also trying to mak them (children) more expressive through arts, drama, etc. Later, mother asked them t teach three languages in the school. So, 2 more languages were introduced – Sanskrit an English. They have developed similar pedagogy for the languages where children learn t identify and correlate sounds with objects, sounds with symbols, etc. through games, cards etc. These languages are taught orally. They don’t teach reading and writing in this school. I also got to know that children from age 3 to 7 study here. After, completing third year they go to primary school.
        <br/> <br/>
        Kalaben says that it’s very easy for children to pick up 2-3 languages orally. At this stage, introduction of reading and writing exercises makes it difficult to learn the language. So, children engage in conversation, music, poems, listening to stories, arts, crafts and games (teachers do it to improve their motor skills, expression and understanding). They learn to write their names in third year.
        <br/> <br/>
        She also shared a unique norm set by the school. Parents are not allowed to leave their children and go from the school. Either mother or father has to stay back in the school with the child for a few days (till the child is comfortable). has a very interesting insight about managing behavioural issues. She says that her intuition helped her to find out the problem and give space to the child to resolve the issue himself/herself and participate positively in the daily processes. She finds teaching to be a very spontaneous actively. She says- ‘one can plan the design and infrastructure. One can plan for the educational resources. But, it’s difficult to plan your daily behaviour with children.’

        <h1>My experience in the school </h1>
        <p>
        The day started with prayer. After saying the prayer, a music audio was played. They have composed very nice and soothing music which children are supposed to listen silently. Teachers also asked them to sit in proper posture (with their head and spine erect) during this session.
        <br/><br/>
        After the prayer, they sit in three groups. I was able to observe two groups during this time period. One of the classes was learning music while another group was learning Sanskrit.
        <br/> <br/>
        During my observation in music class, I found that most of the children were attentive and smiling. One teacher was playing the piano and children were attentively listening. Children were sitting with their head and spine erect. I could not understand the language but the children seemed to be enjoying the music and were participating with full energy and discipline.
        <br/> <br/>
        Then, I went to Sanskrit class. Sanskrit is taught twice a week. Here, teachers were trying to teach numbers in Sanskrit through activities. One of the teachers was saying numbers while showing their fingers. All the children were supposed to repeat with actions. This activity was successfully done. Then, she further complicated the activity by not speaking the numbers in sequence and they had to show fingers for the numbers. Children were finding it difficult to comprehend and instantly what their teachers were trying to say. Teachers were getting a mixed response from the students.
        <br/> <br/>
        Later, they introduced rings for colours. These were big rings (diameter- about 2 feet). Whenever, teacher named any colour they had to jump in the ring. While one or two children were doing it, others had to observe and tell whether they were doing successfully or not! I found these activities to be interesting, however I could not understand whether only two periods per week is sufficient for learning a language when it is not being spoken at home or in immediate environment/nearby localities.
