        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
        Sri Aurobindo wanted to bring forth an educational centre where the next generation of human beings can come to study and evolve together. This vision was implemented by the ‘mother’ in 1946 when they started the first school in Pondicherry. From its very beginning, this centre aspired to be an international centre of education. It began as a basic school in 1943 and gradually became an international university and research centre by 1952.
        <br/> <br/>
        This work took a lot of time to evolve because their concept and aims of education were different from mainstream schools. They did not want to become a ‘degree offering’ institute. Instead of degrees, they wanted to develop excellence and character in their students. Thus, they set up a school where children can experience a very deep and meaningful education. This centre follows principles of integral education. Its aims and objectives are driven by this concept.

        <p>
        We went to Shiv Kumar Ji (Director - Sri Aurobindo Society), Shraddhalu Ji (scientist and teacher educator), Gayatri Ben (Head – Aurobindo Primary Wing), Kalaben and many other teachers to understand Integral Education and how it is being implemented. These people spent a lot of time discussing the core principles and aims of Integral education with us (while they were showing the school and its processes. We asked this question from Shiv Kumar Ji (why so much emphasis on discussing the concept and aims, etc.) He said that it’s very important to be aware of the aims of education. When the aims and objectives of education are clear then we can easily come up with a curriculum. For example in physical education, the central idea/aim is to develop physique in a manner that helps to do our daily chores effectively and also to help us develop spiritually. Thus, the sub-objectives are - how to eat food, how to breathe, how to do correct exercise, how to be more aware about the body, how to take rest, how to increase our subtle energy etc. Then, the teacher tries to establish a correlation between sub-objectives and curriculum can be developed accordingly.

        <h1>Integral Education</h1>
        <p>
        Integral education throws light on developing 5 different aspects of human beings. Sri Aurobindo says every human has got these dimensions of personality which are as follows-
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Physical</li>
            <li>Mental</li>
            <li>Vital (prana, energy, emotions)</li>
            <li>Psychic</li>
            <li>Psychic</li>
        </ol>
        <br/>
        <p>
        Integral education is not about working on each dimension separately. It’s about identifying the child (human being) as a soul and facilitating such an education in which growth of the ‘soul’ remains the central idea. So, in each educational process/scenario the teacher considers psychic and spiritual development of the child (while working on development of physical, mental and vital as well). This is done by developing a sense of inquiry, mindfulness, sensitivity towards self and other human beings, engaging with social work, nature, arts, crafts and music etc.

       <h1>Further :</h1>
       <p>
       For facilitating such an education, they wanted to create an environment which automatically inspires the students to work on above 5 dimensions of their ‘being’ so that their ‘doing’ exemplifies problem solving attitude, excellence and character. This environment was created through following measures -
       </p>
       <br/>
       <ol>
            <li>
                <h2>Explicit presence of philosophy –</h2>
                <p>This brings confidence and shared vision. Teachers know why they are doing what they are doing. It increases their sense of accomplishment. It also helps in deciding curriculum, syllabus, textbooks, assignments, assessment, etc. It’s difficult to do when the teachers don’t subscribe to a common philosophy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Teachers</h2>
                <p>They have kept very effective entry barriers for teaching. Most of the teachers are well qualified practitioners who understand and practice integral education. I was surprised to see such teachers who keep updating their knowledge as per global standards. E.g – their computer teacher is teaching robotics to senior school students and they are able to make robots and exhibit them. Children are also learning python from him. To my surprise, none of them takes more than regular expenses from Ashram to teach. This is also creating problems for them (talented teachers from newer generation are not willing to compromise w.r.t their financial aspirations) but still somehow their system is working.</p>
                <p>We discussed minimum expectations from a teacher with Shiv Kumar Ji. He gave us following points-</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Teacher should be a living example/ a practitioner</li>
                    <li>Practitioner – remain in touch with source, start living inside-outside.</li>
                    <li>Once teachers start within themselves, they know how to guide others.</li>
                    <li>Final aim of the teacher should be to make the child come in contact with the inner teacher. If it is not done, whatever we can do, education is going to be a failure.</li>
                    <li>There is an intelligence that does millions of processes. Become conscious of it, develop it, how to develop children/adults – get in touch with it?</li>
                </ul>
                
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Community living helps students and also in teacher education</h2>
                <p>Teachers live here as a community. They eat together, play together and moreover help each other grow as teachers. They are also part of the administration. It’s a nice way of teacher professional development. I think it’s the most effective way to develop teachers. Not only in teacher education, it’s helpful for the students as well. Students’ exposure to the life and behaviour of the teacher increases. This opens the way for informal interactions and the teacher also doesn’t need to put extra efforts to know the children. Community living is a more effective and sustainable method (by design) for education. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Unique design of Infrastructure and its benefits–</h2>
                <p>
                    They have separate buildings for kindergarten, primary and high school. In addition to it, they have got large rooms for arts and crafts, carpentry, clay work & sculpture, science labs – one each for physics, chemistry, biology, etc. Each room has got enough space to sit and work along with modern equipment, books, articles and resources. 
                    <br/> <br/>
                    Each room gives a feel of the subject it’s about. For example - Hundreds of small and big carvings and sculptures (earthen lamps, pots, fruits, vegetables, animals, human beings, great personalities, etc.) were kept in the clay work room. One teacher is specially assigned for this task. Teacher prepares material for the students to use (fine clay, wheel, colour, equipment, etc. and also guides them through the process.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    Similarly, we visited each place and saw that teachers were concerned with the subject work (preparing resources/assignments) there and students joined them during the day. For example – we saw a class 11 student who had prepared a foosball (table football) table without purchasing anything from outside (only steel rods and wood were purchased). Rest of it was developed by him. Next day, we were surprised to see the same student doing research in the biology lab with his microbiology teacher (the teacher has come from the US to stay and teach in Aurobindo Ashram). They have identified a microbe which can consume plastics. They are doing various tests to identify its behaviour and whether it is harmless for human beings or the environment or not. (Cross-check repercussions). 
                    <br/> <br/>  
                    They have special emphasis on making things after understanding the theory (applies to science, arts, craft, etc). All the students design different things and then make it. Teacher’s job is to assist them during the process. They help them through asking questions that help them think deeper, design related suggestions, demonstration etc.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    Separate learning spaces (rooms) for different subjects are something we can consider in our long-term projects. It exposes the child to good work done by other children, plenty of resources and more personalized mentoring.

                <h2>Library</h2>
                <p>This centre values reading and readers. They have got a lot of books for the students. We found out that there were two sections in the reading room/library. Outer section was for issue and return of books, reading and discussion, etc. Inner room was for silent study. The aesthetics and silence of the inner reading room/library is quite unique and reader friendly. (In this room, light was neither too bright nor too dull, the colour of the wall was attractive but soothing to the eyes, furniture/cushions were properly placed, etc.)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Long term education guided by one centre</h2>
                <p>Admitted in the Kindergarten at the age of 3 years, the child moves through the following academic sections :</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Name</th>
                        <th>Level</th>
                        <th>Ages</th>
                        <th>Years</th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Jardin d'Enfant</th>
                        <td>Kindergarten </td>
                        <td>3-6</td>
                        <td>3 years</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Avenir</th>
                        <td>Primary</td>
                        <td>6-9</td>
                        <td>3 years</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Progrès</th>
                        <td>Primary</td>
                        <td>9-12</td>
                        <td>3 years</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>En Avant vers la Perfection</th>
                        <td>Secondary</td>
                        <td>12-18</td>
                        <td>6 years</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Cours Supérieur</th>
                        <td>college</td>
                        <td>18-21</td>
                        <td>3 years</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>This age-wise division helps to provide appropriate instruction, content, daily processes, etc. For example – </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They focus on teaching comprehension and expression in Kindergarten school. They don’t teach reading and writing.</li>
                    <li>They have separate assembly and prayer for each category of children (as children from one age group are able to relate to each other and have similar interests, questions, experiences) etc.</li>
                    <li>They don’t introduce meditation at a young age. Sometimes, sitting in silence or working silently is encouraged to go deeper within them. We saw it on the sports ground also when they began the game with a few moments of silence.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <h2>Physical education</h2>
                <p> It needs a special mention. It is the most well organized physical education I have ever seen in my life. They have two huge buildings and two playgrounds dedicated for this purpose. One of the buildings is for gymnasium, gymnastics, wrestling, judo, boxing etc. while other has facilities like swimming pool, basketball, track and field, etc. (well-maintained track and ground).  However, they don’t prepare children for national/international competitions. It’s solely dedicated to their spiritual growth through physical development. They play games intensely but keep changing games. So, specialization in one game is something that they don’t encourage. They also shared the rationale behind such a schedule. They say that it helps to work on different aspects of physical development and personality. Each game and activity has something unique to offer. Each student goes through regular medical check-ups and nutrition. They have also appointed well trained coaches who pay individual attention to each student during the process. Some alumni and ashram members also join students in sports activities. They have also kept magazines and books on physical development. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Solar power production</h2>
                <p>
                They have tried to teach self-reliance and skills through multiple modes. Ashram members still engage in stitching, embroidery, and production related work. Their food is prepared in a common kitchen. Similarly, they have done something similar for power generation as well. This school produces a huge amount of electricity to meet its needs. After providing supply to the entire Ashram, this unit also gives electricity to the grid in Puducherry. Thus, it meets energy needs of neighbourhood localities as well. All the work related to setting up solar panels, wiring, etc. was done by students.
                <br/> <br/>
                The process started with studying the power consumed by different electronic devices and then they were compared with their energy efficient alternatives. For example, the energy required for a normal bulb (incandescent light bulb) can light 10 LED bulbs. So, these bulbs and other equipment were replaced with better alternatives in order to save power. They say that any school can build this model.
                <br/> <br/>
                This school is worth visiting for understanding Aurobindo’s philosophy (Shiv Kumar ji and Shraddhaluji helped a lot in this area) and also to observe some design and curriculum related innovations. E.g. passion and commitment of teachers and mutual relationship, creation of resource rooms instead of classrooms, integral curriculum for subjects, physical education, teaching of arts, crafts and music, teaching of physical, mental and emotional awareness, etc.
