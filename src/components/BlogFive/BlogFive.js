        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
        We met Jyoti Ji and Miriam Ji - teachers from Nandanam and Aha Kindergarten School who have
sustained and improved these two learning spaces for young children over a long period of time.
These meetings helped us to study and appreciate many theoretical and practical aspects of running
a Kindergarten school. We observed the design, educational resources and books; also the art and
craft work done by the children. In addition to it, we got to know about two highly useful and
relevant practices – ATB (awareness through the body) and Sandbox. These exercises are designed
according to various development needs of children; especially for helping them connect with deeper
aspects of their being. At this stage (kindergarten age group), teachers show a lot of reverence for
aesthetics, positive relationship and atmosphere in the school. They reinforced it while sharing their
experiences and insights. They have developed very nice curriculum and infrastructure; still they
consider the teacher as the most significant resource in the school. It was best explained by Jyoti ji –
“A teacher has to evolve and keep taking the necessary steps that improves the learning environment
and processes in the school. That demands tremendous amount of work on self before starting to
work with children. She gave her personal example – “If I am worried about some problem, then I
can‟t bring radiating energy.”
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Infrastructure</strong> - We found that each and every place in the school is designed and maintained with
a child centred perspective. We were simply mesmerized by the simplicity and beauty of the place.
        </p>     

<p>
If we will look at the entire infrastructure and design, we can easily feel that it has the potential to
create plenty of activities for integral education. They have child friendly walls and windows which
gives the challenge and comfort to play, climb and sit. The garden has many types of plants, trees
and flowers. They have also built see-saws, swings, slides, etc. One of the corners in the garden is
specially designed for sand-play (a place where children create something with sand, act, dance, and
jump and play freely). They have a big hall for ATB (awareness through the body) activities and an
experienced teacher to conduct ATB. Children also learn arts, craft, dance, music, etc. It is taught in a
manner so that it doesn‟t become performance oriented. Teachers feel that arts, crafts, music and
theatre should be process oriented and should enable the child to express their feelings, thoughts,
insights, etc. creatively.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Age group of children coming to the Nandanam School:</strong>2 years 6 months - 6 years 6 months.  
</p>
<br />
<p>
    <strong>Age group of children coming to the Aha Kindergarten School:</strong>3 years – 7 years.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Multi-lingual and multicultural school -</strong>These children live with their parents in Auroville. Their
parents come from different nations and culture and stay in Auroville. These children speak different
languages at home. For example – someone speaks tamil, some French, some English, hindi, etc. It is
an ideal example of a multi-lingual school where they respect different languages and include their
songs, poems, etc. However, for convenience, English is the language of communication and
instruction. Most of the children come to school with their parents.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Communication with parents –</strong>
    Most of teacher‟s work is centred on children as they don‟t get adequate time from parents. Teachers
don‟t discuss individual child if there‟s a collective meeting with parents. It‟s during individual
conversations that they receive and give feedback. Teachers feel that it very important to share
experiences, give and receive feedback with parents.

       <h1>Discussion with teachers – key points</h1>
      <p>
      They shared 3 guiding principles and connected it to how the school is being run –
      </p>
    
        <p>  
        <ol>
            <li>
            Nothing can be taught – teacher cannot force or impose any thought/action on the students.
He can‟t force knowledge, instead allows them to perfect their instruments of knowledge.
            </li>
            <li>
            Mind must be consulted in its own growth - self-explanatory.
            </li>
            <li>
            Work from near to far – concrete experiences to far-fetched ideas and abstraction. At this

stage, teachers work on developing child‟s instruments of knowledge. For example-
increasing sensitivity so that they can make use of their senses and mind more effectively.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Teacher’s role</strong> in this space is to observe the child, listen to his/her needs, and provide support in
learning. One of the teachers explained to us how young children are closer to the source of wisdom
and that‟s why they need a positive environment and a little amount of support to learn. It was really
interesting to understand why these teachers give so much importance to observing and listening to
the children. They shared that they are very cautious that they don‟t over-teach and thus being
observant helps. The teacher also shared that over-teaching or over-correction is not helpful in the
long run. For example - If a teacher observes that 4-5 children are playing well, then he/she doesn‟t
need to interfere. It‟s very important that the teacher allows them to take physical and emotional

risks while playing with their peers. This helps in further in increasing self-awareness and inter-
personal skills. They have developed some daily procedures and systems that help to develop love for

aesthetics and order. E.g. making kolam in morning before starting the day, arranging footwear in
order, keeping arts/crafts related material in its place, fixing drawings by children on walls, etc.

They also shared Sri Aurobindo and the mother‟s thoughts on education of young children to help us
understand further. They said- “Mother and Sri Aurobindo have given us the vision but they have not
told about each step to be taken”. For example – the mother has said that beauty and harmony
should be present in a school. Now, „how that manifests‟ is done by the architects and teachers. They
have improved the infrastructure, design and school processes as per their experience with children.
Now, this space is able to easily accommodate 60 children for active learning as well as relaxed and
silent learning. The mother has put lot of emphasis on development of senses and physical
development. Therefore, one of the key roles of the teacher is to make as many games as possible in
order to provide diverse sensory experiences and help them make meaning out of these experiences.
It is also done to help them improve their strength, flexibility, spontaneity and control over the body.
ATB (awareness through the body) exercises grew out of this quest for providing qualitative
education that helps the body, mind, prana and soul to grow.

<br />

<p>
    <strong>Team work</strong>
    <br />They are very particular about teacher pupil ratio and adequate space for teaching and learning.
That‟s why they are running 3 kindergarten schools within the premises. Each kindergarten is an
independent institution and they plan their sessions according to their objectives and needs. Sri
Aurobindo and mother‟s thoughts decide their guidelines while they work on details. Each class has at
least two teachers who plan their sessions together. However, they don‟t try to give a homogenous
style of teaching to children.

        <h1>Some questions asked by us - teachers’ response</h1>
        <p>
       <strong>How do we know a child’s sensory knowledge is growing up?</strong> 
<br />
<ol>
        <li>Teacher‟s observation</li>
        <li>Challenge that he/she is taking up</li>
        <li>Documents/work done by children</li>
        <li>Engage and interact</li>
        <li>Follow each child (his/her journey)</li>
        
</ol>
        </p>

        <p>
       <strong>Do you have any mechanism of passing on your inputs about the child to the primary
teacher?</strong> 
<br /> Yes we meet them once/twice to share our experiences about the child. Generally, primary teachers
tell us what kind of preparedness they expect when the student makes this transition. We try to
accommodate their expectations in our processes.

        </p>
        
        <p>
       <strong>How do you incorporate various learning styles and types in the classroom processes?</strong> 
<br /> We understand that there are various types of intelligence (reference - Howard gardener‟s theory,
Multiple Intelligence). But, we try to develop each and every kind of intelligence so that it helps them
in the long run. An ideal person is someone who can learn through various modes- audio,
kinaesthetic, visual, etc.
<br />If a child doesn‟t feel like participating in group activity then they provide arts and crafts, games, etc.

        </p>

    <p>
        <br />
        <h1>Sandbox</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>This game draws its learning from 2 disciplines – psychology and art.</li>
            <li>This is a very unique intervention which increases creativity and self-awareness.</li>
            <li>This also helps to develop sensitivity, aesthetic sense and language and through spontaneous
role plays. Children get plenty of opportunities to work individually and in pairs, groups. Most
of the time this activity inspires them to come up with interesting stories, role-plays, etc.</li>
            <li>It is observed that this activity makes the children more happy and relaxed.</li>
            <li>This activity is done by an experienced teacher who knows better about the concept,
objectives and related processes. (We could not meet the teacher, so unable to produce
details). However, this interaction helped us to go back and read more about sandbox and its
relevance in kindergarten schools. We found out that it utilizes therapeutic value of arts,
atmosphere of trust and positive relationship with teacher. However, we are still exploring
various activities to find out the simple and relevant ones which can be tried in our
classrooms. We are not planning to name it sandbox as it has evolved as a discipline and we
are not very informed about it. But, we understood the importance of designing effective art
processes which allows that child to make more meaning of themselves and relationship with
people, nature and things around them.</li>

        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
    <h1>Schedule – Nicely balanced between highly energetic activities and relaxing activities</h1>
    <ul>
        <ol>
            <li>1 hour free play</li>
            <li>1⁄2 hour – circle (sing songs, stories, activity)</li>
            <li>Play again</li>
            <li>Arts, craft, music activities</li>
            <li>Awareness through the body (twice a week)</li>
            <li>Sandbox</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>

    <p>
    <h1>Internship for young teachers</h1>
    <br />
    They don‟t consider providing internships for short period of time. Jyoti ji explained the reason behind
this decision – “It‟s difficult to win the trust of children and build positive relationships. It takes time.
So, we prefer someone who has genuine interest and wants to work with us at least for 6 months.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h1>Crèche</h1>
        <br />This school has allocated a big room for this purpose. The design is done in a way that all the
educational resources are easily accessible to children. Children spend 6 months with parents in this
space where they are exposed wide variety of toys, arts and crafts, games etc.
